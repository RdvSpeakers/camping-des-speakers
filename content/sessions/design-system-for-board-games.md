You may know Wordle, a simple addictive guess-a-word game that went all over the Web in just a few months. Its UI is simple but a perfect use-case for a thing I had in mind for a long time: building a Design System for a board game using Open Standards.

So it is! I rebuilt Wordle's UI components from scratch, in Web Components, so I made an entire Design System for a board game, agnostic of any reactive framework to let others build the logic code part using their favorite tools.

This talk will guide you on the process of making a board game Design System with the same kind of technologies to quickly and efficiently build and ship cool games ♠️! Same player, shoot again.
