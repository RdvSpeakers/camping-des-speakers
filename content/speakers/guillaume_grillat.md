After being a recruiter in several digital companies, I decided to move on and took on new responsibilities at Deezer by joining the Engineering department on an original role in 2017, as the first Tech Community Ambassador in France. I'm currently working at leboncoin, my job is pretty unique; we're 2 or 3 people doing it in France : I focus on how to retain our people through "learning experiences" with external tech communities (other companies living similar contexts, developer groups, Engineering schools & networks etc.). Depending on your needs, you adapt the kind of event: meetup, workshop, conference etc. Learning from other external best practices is key to stay innovative and attractive on our pure-player market.

My goal ? Helping my Product & Tech colleagues to flourish at work, by meeting exciting & innovative people & gaining new knowledge. It is all about curiosity, humility, and the joy of learning. I'm organizing lbcÂ², our tech conference at leboncoin (talks from Netflix, Zalando, Doctolib in 2021):[https://www.lbc2.fr/](https://www.lbc2.fr/)

I'm also part of the Tech.Rocks Content Committee, the biggest tech leaders network in France. Check it out : [https://www.tech.rocks/](https://www.tech.rocks/)
