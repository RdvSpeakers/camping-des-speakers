I am a senior developer with 10 years of experience in various fields ranging from web development to big data, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence. My experience combines technical and analytical aptitudes with problem-solving strengths to drive projects to on-time and high-quality completion.

I also have a Ph.D. in optimizing the performance of multi-tier distributed systems.

Currently, I am a Senior DevOps Engineer at ATOS. We are working on a Video analysis project based on dockerized microservice architecture.

I love communicating and sharing knowledge ;) ( and of course sport;) )

My motto in life is LIVE + LOVE + LAUGH :)
